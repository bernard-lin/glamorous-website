# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're going to teach you `glamorous` by having you edit the guide you're reading ðŸ˜±

# Titles

Let's start by making the headings on this page look nice. With `glamorous`,
instead of the normal CSS syntax you maybe familiar with, we work with regular JavaScript
objects.

Change the `Heading` to this:

```js
const Heading = glamorous.h1({
  fontSize: '2.4em',
  marginTop: 10,
  color: '#CC3A4B',
})
```

#Links

Change the `Link` to this:
```js
const Link = glamorous.a({

})
```


# Help!

That's all we have for now, but if you'd like to help with this guide that'd be
super! Please check out [the GitHub repo!](https://github.com/kentcdodds/glamorous-website)
